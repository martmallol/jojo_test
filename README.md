# Jojo's Quiz Game
![Page Example](/src/img/page-sample.png)
Which JoJo Character Are You? Guess which hero fits your personality. You can try it with your friends and compare their results with yours!

## Overview
### Users should be able to:
- Answer all questions and get their proper character.
- Play again, or go back to a previous question if they'd like to.
- Share their results with their friends.
- Flip every card available. If they do it, they'll get the timestamp and the episode where that scene occurs.

### Built with
- React JS
- Flexbox
- CSS

### What I learnt
- Create a functional React App. 
- Be able to store data (such as the user's answers) for a final purpose: returning the character that best fits the answers that were chosen.
- Integrate an API (Web Share API)
- Create a desktop and a mobile page design for the app. 

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
