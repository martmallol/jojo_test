## Possible Features
- Add a new character by searching it's name on a bar. It should communicate with an api that throws the name of the character and it's photo.
- Add new questions
- Add a "pie" diagram (like in JoJos cutscenes) for every character
- Set multiple time intervals for every component on the 'You are...' page. So every object appears on the screen at different times.
- QR at the end to share your results. I could also add some social network logos.
